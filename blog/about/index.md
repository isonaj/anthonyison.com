> Hi! I'm Anthony. I'm one of the Senior Software Architects over at [SSW](http://ssw.com.au). If you like what you're reading here, you may also be interested in reading posts from my colleagues, too. Check them out at the [SSW Blog](https://blog.ssw.com)!

Anthony has over 20 years of development experience across many industries including stockbroking, microfinance and retail/point of sale. He has a keen interest in software and database performance, reducing running costs and reducing problems through simple solutions. His experience in team lead and agile coaching roles contributes to his ability to produce great outcomes for clients.

In his spare time, he loves learning new technologies and development techniques and blogging about these adventures. He is strongly motivated to give back to the community as a token of gratitude to all of the great mentors he's had throughout his career. He would escape to a hobby farm in the country, given half a chance, even though his horticultural skills leave much to be desired.

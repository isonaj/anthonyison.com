I thought SEO was for people trying to cheat the system with search engines. You know, pick some keywords and try to cram them into every piece of content and meta tag until half the page is made up of keywords. I think it's fair to say that I was wrong. <!-- more -->

I build web applications, and one of the most important things in a web application is the logging and reporting from that application. It's not just for working out what is broken, but also for working out what's working. That's where the logging rubber hits the road and becomes something really valuable - METRICS! When you can see where your traffic is coming from and where it's going to, you can identify high traffic areas and add some polish. Maybe there's a process, but most of your traffic drops out at a certain point. This type of information is invaluable.

So, what do *I* mean when I say SEO (and in case you don't know, that's short for Search Engine Optimisation)? I am talking METRICS! Who are my users? Where are they from? What are they searching for? How far down the post are they reading?

> If you've come looking for keyword stuffing, and ways to cheat the system to improve your ranking, I'd say this post isn't for you... However, you could probably use it for the dark side, too.

## Where do I start?

To get started with metrics, you need tools. The tools I use are:
* Google Analytics
* Search Console
* Momently

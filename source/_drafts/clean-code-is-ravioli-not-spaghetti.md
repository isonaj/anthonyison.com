I'll start by saying, this is not a new idea. Everyone seems to know spaghetti code, even from the outside. Have you had that moment when you asked to change something and that's working just fine, but something else just failed six ways to Sunday? You, my friend, have spaghetti code.

Spagehitti code is basically code with poor boundaries. You know that friend in a co-dependent relationship, that just won't stand their ground and say no when they mean no? Or that work colleague that just says yes to everything and then complains they've got too much on their plate? That's the one. Code can do exactly the same thing. Code can bite off too much and it can become entangled with other code so you're not sure where one begins and the other ends.

To write better code, you need to follow [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID). SOLID code conforms to:
* **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
* **O**pen Closed Principle
* **L**iskov Substition Principle
* **I**nterface Segregation Principle
* **D**ependency Inversion Principle

Ravioli is not like spaghetti. Spaghetti spreads out, through and tangles with other pieces of spaghetti. Ravioli, on the other hand, are small contained parcels with clear boundaries. Ravioli code conforms to the Single Responsibility Principle (and the Dependency Inversion Principle, but I'll discuss that later).

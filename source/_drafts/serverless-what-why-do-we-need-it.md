title: Serverless what? Why do we need it?

"Serverless" was one of those terms that left me scratching my head when I first heard it. How on earth do you run a server... without a server??? That's some crazy marketing spin! What I quickly learned is that serverless is referring to how much infrastructure you need to manage. That is, none. Nada.

So who cares? I mean, I'm running on PaaS. I can change the number of servers with a slider, or set rules to automatically add and remove servers as my traffic changes. Isn't that good enough? Not according to [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com). When your traffic spikes (like, when a million people pick up their phone at the same time and hit your site), you can go from "too much cloud" to "not enough cloud" very quickly.

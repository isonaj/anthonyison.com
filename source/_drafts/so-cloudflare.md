title: So... Cloudflare...

I went to a great talk by Troy Hunt in Brisbane last week. Well, it was great at the time. It didn't take long before I started to realise that most of the struggles I've had getting my blog up and running could have actually been side stepped quite nicely by using Cloudflare.

Let me be clear. This wasn't the first time I heard of Cloudflare. To be honest, I didn't actually know what it was before now though, and Troy has a way of presenting things so that they seem really quite simple. Cloudflare seems to provide a service that just puts a bow on hosted services: Free SSL, CDN/caching, DNS, traffic management. Cloudflare aim to have an edge within 10ms of every client on the planet.

title: Migrating from Ghost to Hexo

It was surprisingly easy to migrate my blog out of ghost, but there were a few missed steps along the way. Often, I would find a better way after I had done the heavy lifting.

## 1. Install Hexo and create the blog
## 2. Install the hexo-casper theme
## 3. Configure the theme and site
## 4. Migrate posts from ghost to hexo
## 5. Reattach the post images

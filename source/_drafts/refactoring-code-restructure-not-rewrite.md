title: 'Refactoring code - restructure, not rewrite'

I see a lot of similarities between software and business structures. If I'm talking about a queuing mechanism, it often helps to describe it as a call centre managing their tickets, or a lock as being like a key for the toilets. Refactoring then, would simply be a restructuring of a business, however developers often mean they want fire everyone and start over.

It's always possible that a business is in a state where this is needed, however small changes to a working system can produce incredible results. Software is expensive. I mean, REALLY expensive. So, let's not burn down the house just because we no longer like the decor.

As a developer, refactoring is a one of your daily chores. The thing about a daily chore is that, when it's not done, it kind of builds up. If you never do your chores, you might find that you have a BIG job to get things neat and tidy again. And then, even if you stay on top of your chores, you might find you need an spring clean now and then just to get to the areas that aren't being kept on a daily basis.

## 1. Scoring your software
In software, everything is a tradeoff, so it helps to understand what you have and what you've traded for it. To help understand, there is benefit to scoring your software in many factors, such as:
* Correctness
* Stability
* Performance
* Complexity
* Flexibility

## 2. Have a reason for change
When software feels old and buggy, there's usually a strong desire to either change everything all at once or to rewrite the software altogether. There is so much hope in a greenfield project, but it doesn't last. It's easy to think you will do it better next time, but often, you won't. Maybe you will make the same mistakes, maybe different ones.
Instead, find a current request

## 3. Only change one thing at a time
Refactoring is a mechanical process. In fact, many operations can be automated. The idea is to do one change from beginning to end. Decide on the next change and do that. Avoid the lure to "just do this one thing while I'm here". Most refactorings that have lead to me deleting my changes and starting over have been from trying to do too many things at once.

## 3. Naming is important, but be careful not to go overboard

## 4. Take opportunities to reduce complexity

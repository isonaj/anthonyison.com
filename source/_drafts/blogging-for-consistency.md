I've been writing a few blogs now and try to get feedback each time. The feedback has been great and helps me to improve. I'm building up a list of things to think about as I'm writing. In this blog, I want to focus on the feedback and break down what's important.

# Quality and meeting expectations
## Fix the broken bits
If there is something that doesn't work, and you know it doesn't work, fix it. This might seem obvious, but I have overlooked it a couple of times now. It's just embarrassing to ask for feedback and be given a list of things you already know.

## Meet expectations
There is a baseline for features that you need to consider on your blog.
~~A blog is expected to have support for a range of features out of the box, such as:~~
* Comments (according to [Scott Hanselman](), if you don't support comments, you don't have a blog!)
* RSS
* Email subscription
* Links to easily share posts on social media
* SEO - Your readers deserve to [find you](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EmbraceAuthorshipTheImportanceOfRelmeAndRelauthorOnYourContentsSEOAndGoogle.aspx).

# Consistency: Make a checklist
## Standards
* Filenames should be `highlighted`
* Specify your code block types when using Prism (some things to remember are: html is `markup` and command line is `bash`)
* Specify your command line code blocks with `bash`. Begin each command with `$` and split across lines for long statements. Identify the line break with `/`. If adding a comment, use `#`.

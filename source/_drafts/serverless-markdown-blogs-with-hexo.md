title: Serverless markdown blogs with Hexo
tags:

Let me start this by saying I'm loving my ghost blog, and I get a kick out of running it on AKS. The thing is, the content only changes when I post and so I'm thinking about caching and I realise the whole blog can be cached. It's not an API. I don't have changing data. (Ok, TECHNICALLY I have a db, but bear with me) My posts are markdown, and I could just store them in git and publish static pages when I push.

Yada, yada, i could use Jekyll, Hexo, Github pages, other ???

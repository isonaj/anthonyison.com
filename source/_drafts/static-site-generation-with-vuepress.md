When I was reviewing static site generators, Vuepress caught my eye but I passed over it quickly because their web site admitted that they [lacked blogging support](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/#todo). I really like the approach though. It uses the Vue.js server side processing to generate static sites. It's time to have a closer look.

# Creating content
It's really easy to get started with Vuepress. 
1. Create a folder and change directory to it
2. Create `README.md`
3. Run `npm init` in the folder
4. Run `npm i vuepress --save`

# Adding a theme

# Downloading a theme
One of the things I prefer about Vuepress is that themes rely on a single config that you provide.

# Blogging support
In [this post](/blogging-for-consistency), I looked at some of the expectations for a blog. Let's take a look at which parts we can hit with Vuepress.

## Comments
I use Disqus for comments and I can make that work with Vuepress.

## RSS

## SEO
SEO is basically content for search engines ...

# Vuepress vs Hexo
Alright, I would never have looked into Vuepress if this wasn't in the back of my mind. Let's take a look at some of the strengths and weaknesses of the two.

## Hexo
Pros:
* Simple to create new posts
* Flexible theme options
Cons: 
* Themes have inconsistent technologies

## Vuepress
Pros:
* Easy to create new posts
* Themes have consistent Vue.js approach
Cons:
* 
# Summary
Is Vuepress worth considering for blogs? I think so.

When I was reviewing static site generators, Vuepress caught my eye. I didn't look too closely though because their web site admitted that they [lacked blogging support](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/#todo). I really like the approach though. It uses the Vue.js server side processing to generate static sites. It's time to have a closer look.

# Creating content

# Adding a theme

# Downloading a theme
One of the things I prefer about Vuepress is that themes rely on a single config that you provide.

# Blogging support
In [this post](/blogging-for-consistency), I looked at some of the expectations for a blog. Let's take a look at which parts we can hit with Vuepress.
